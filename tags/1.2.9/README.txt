====================================
Welcome to the Cordys Generic LDAP Connector
====================================
The Generic LDAP connector allows you to connect to a server that implements the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol network protocol (LDAP). 
LDAP is a networking protocol for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP/IP. 
Examples of LDAP servers are Active Directory and OpenLDAP. The Generic LDAP connector provides a connection to the specified 
LDAP and some generic methods to manipulate/read the content.
