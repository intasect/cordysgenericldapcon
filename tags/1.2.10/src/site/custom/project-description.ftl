	The Generic LDAP connector allows you to connect to a server that implements the 
	Lightweight Directory Access Protocol network protocol (LDAP). LDAP is a networking 
	protocol for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP/IP. Examples of LDAP 
	servers are Active Directory and OpenLDAP. The Generic LDAP connector provides a connection to 
	the specified LDAP and some generic methods to manipulate/read the content.
